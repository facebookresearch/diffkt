The Logistics Regression notebook shows how to use **DiffKt** to solve logistics regression problems, where one has a
binary output with a Poisson distribution, with the data in a tensor, and a gradient descent algorithm using 
automatic differentiation as the optimization algorithm to minimize the problem.
