The Introduction to Basic API Operations for **DiffKt** tutorial will explain how to use the 
**DiffKT** API to write Kotlin programs using automatic differentiation.

The tutorial will explain what tensors and scalars are in **DiffKt**, and how to write 
mathematical functions using the **DiffKt** mathematical operations, and evaluate 
the function and its derivative at a particular value.
