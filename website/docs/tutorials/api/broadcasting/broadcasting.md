The Broadcasting tutorial for **DiffKt** shows how to use broadcasting with tensors. 
Broadcasting is an operation where one can do operations on tensors that are different sizes, 
and parts of a tensor are replicated to make the sizes of two tensors equal. 

Broadcasting is used in Python and **DiffKt's** implementation is similar.<br/>
