Differentiable programming is a process of computing derivative over functions automatically. 
These functions can operate on floating point values, tensors, and user-defined data structures containing them.

## Background on Differentiable Programming

Below are some review papers and a book on differentiable programming. 
The field is also called automatic differentiation or algorithmic differentiation.
