**DiffKt** is a Kotlin library for building mathematical functions that can be 
automatically differentiation. Automatic differentiation is a software method that 
can take a mathematical function represented as a software function
and produce the derivative of the function using the 
chain rule and the elementary arithmatic operations in the functions.

There are many automatic differentiation packages 
in other language such as Fortran, C++, or Python. **DiffKt** brings automatic 
differentiation to Kotlin. **DiffKt** is one of the most advanced automatic 
differentiation packages in the open source community, and for the JVM. **DiffKt** 
incorporates the latest research in automatic differentiation.

**DiffKt** can be used for scientific computing, deep neural networks, machine learning,
statistics, optimization, or physical systems modeling. **DiffKt** provides a framework to 
build functions over multi-dimension array, called tensors, and lets you build complex data
structure with its user defined types.
