    "In a previous notebook we examined a linear regression using DiffKt and gradient descent. Linear regressions are not appropriate for classification and probability prediction models because its output values are infinite in range, as they produce a straight line extending into positive and negative infinity. We will use another model called **logistic regression**, which bends a linear function into an S-shaped curve so that its outputs are between $ 0.0 $ and $ 1.0 $, therefore resembling a probability between  $ 0% $ and $ 100% $.  \n",

    "In this notebook, we will learn how to build a logistic regression from scratch in Kotlin. We will use DiffKt to calculate the derivatives needed by gradient descent. \n",

Based on our patient data, what is the probability we would see symptoms for a patient with 6 hours of exposure? We simply trace along the x-axis at 6 hours and then see what probability the curve produces. This yields a probability below of $ 0.7274 $. "

    "Now let's fit the sigmoid curve using maximum likelihood estimation. **Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)** is a technique that estimates values for parameters of an assumed probability distribution, and with that assumption we maximize the probability of observing the provided data by changing the parameters. In the case of logistic regression, the assumed probability distribution is the Bernoulli distribution, which has a single parameter $ p $ describing the probability of observing an event. The likelihood function is the probability of observing an event given a value for the Bernoulli distribution parameter $ p $. Therefore the function we want to optimize in this case is the product of the Bernoulli probability mass function (PMF) at each outcome assuming a $ p $ value equal to $ f(x) $. \n",

For each iteration, we adjust the values of $ \\beta_0 $ and $ \\beta_1 $ before calculating the probability, we calculate the probability of producing each observation and multiply them together to get the joint probability. The $ \\beta_0 $ and $ \\beta_1 $ values that produces the highest joint probabilities is the best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the logistic function $ f(x) $ and pass every x-value $ x_i $ through it. These will result in the corresponding Bernoulli probabilities for each x-value, based on the binomial outcome of a [Bernoulli trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial). However we need to handle the false cases too and maximize those. This means $ x_i $ values that correspond to a false $ y_i $ will be expressed as $ 1 - f(x_i) $. This will allow the false observations to be maximized too.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we handle both the true (1) and false (0) cases in a single math expression? Without resorting to `if-then` code? This is what the exponents $ y_i $ and $ 1 - y_i $ are for. We need to express that `if-then` in a mathematical function-friendly way for DiffKt to work. Knowing that any number raised to exponent $ 0 $ will always yield $ 1 $, we can raise the true case to the binary $ y_i $ power and the false case to $ 1 - y_i $ power. This way one of those expressions will always be 1 and when you multiply them together, only one of the cases will apply (since multiplying by 1 does nothing). When $ y_i $ is true (1), the right side of the expression $ (1 - f(x_i))^{1 - y_i} $ will turn to 1 as the exponent becomes 0. When $ y_i $ is false (0), the left side of the expression $ f(x_i)^{y_i} $ will turn to 1 as that exponent is 0. This is a clever way to express binary conditions in a single expression, and we multiply all of them together. \n",

    "There's one more complication though. We need to avoid floating point underflow errors which can happen when you are multiplying a lot of decimals together on a computer, which have memory limitations with decimals. A mathematical hack you can do is take the logarithm `log()` or `ln()` of each element, and because of the additive properties of logarithms you can _add_ the elements together rather than multiply them. \n",

    "Looks good! We can now use the logistic regression to make probability predictions given an input variable. Granted, there are many other measures we would need to take to ensure the logistic regression model is useful, like correlation coefficients, p-values, and train/test splits. But this demonstrates how to use DiffKt to train the logistic regression on a training dataset. "
