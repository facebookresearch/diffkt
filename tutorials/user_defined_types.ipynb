    "\n",
    "When you create a __[DTensor](http://www.diffkt.org/api/api/org.diffkt/-d-tensor/index.html)__ or __[DScalar](http://www.diffkt.org/api/api/org.diffkt/-d-scalar/index.html)__ variable, internally it has an implementation of a function call `wrap()`, which is invoked during differentiation operations. The internal representation is used for both the calculation of the user defined function and the calculation of its derivative. Alternatively, one can create their own user defined type. A user defined type could be a class with __[DTensor](http://www.diffkt.org/api/api/org.diffkt/-d-tensor/index.html)__ or __[DScalar](http://www.diffkt.org/api/api/org.diffkt/-d-scalar/index.html)__ variables, or a list of __[DTensor](http://www.diffkt.org/api/api/org.diffkt/-d-tensor/index.html)__ or __[DScalar](http://www.diffkt.org/api/api/org.diffkt/-d-scalar/index.html)__ variables, or even more complex types. When defining a user created type, one has to implement the `wrap()` function as part of the type. There are a couple ways to implement the `wrap()` function and have it called, which are discussed below.\n",

The functions take a user defined input type, a user defined output type, and a user defined derivative type. In addition, the user defines a function for the calculations, and possibly a function to extract the derivatives from the calculations and place the results into the user defined derivative type. Also, the lambdas `wrapInput` and `wrapOutput` might need to be defined to get the `wrap()` function called internally in the code.
