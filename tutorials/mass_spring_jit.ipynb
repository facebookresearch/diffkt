Mass-Spring systems are one of the models used to represent flexible objects in computer graphics, such as cloth. The Mass-Spring Notebook is an example of a complex system simulation using user defined types. In this notebook it will be demonstrated how to have a list of simulation object, where each object is a composite of multiple objects that can be user defined types."
