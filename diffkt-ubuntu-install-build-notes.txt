	export JAVA_AWT_INCLUDE_PATH=$JAVA_HOME/include/
8. Update your environment
	source .bashrc
9. Install IntelliJ IDEA 
	a) install Python plugin
	b) install Kotlin plugin
	c) install Kotlin Notebook plugin
	d) configure Kotlin Notebook plugin	
10. Install CUDA from NVIDIA
	https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
11. Install cuDNN from NVDIA
	https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download
12. Install OpenBlas
	sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev	
13. Create a github account if you do not have one.
14. Setup your github account to use ssh.
15. Setup your github account to use a token.
16. Install github tools.
	sudo apt-get install gh
17. Install the token into github tools.
18. From Meta, get invited to facebookresearch/diffkt.
19. Fork diffkt to you github account.
20. Clone the fork to your local computer.
	gh repo clone <github-id>/diffkt
21. From Meta, get an account to workspace for the diffkt project.
22. From Meta, get added to the Google docs director for the diffkt project.
23. Review the Getting Started-External Developers in the Google docs director.
24. Check your local diffkt project to see if the original facebookresearch/diffkt.git is upstream
	cd <your git projects>/diffkt
	git remote -v
	
	You should see
	
	origin	git@github.com:<gethub id>/diffkt.git (fetch)
	origin	git@github.com:<gethub id>/diffkt.git (push)
	upstream	git@github.com:facebookresearch/diffkt.git (fetch)
	upstream	git@github.com:facebookresearch/diffkt.git (push)
	
	If you are missing upstream, execute the following.
	
	git remote add upstream git@github.com:facebookresearch/diffkt.git
25. Read the github docs for merging your local repository with upstream.
	https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork
26. In general, pull from upstream and merge, but checkin to origin (your fork) and do a pull request to merge with upstream.
27. cd <you project>/diffkt/cpp/ops
28. Read the readme.md
29. Install OpenMP
	sudo apt install libomp-dev
	
	and/or
	
	sudo apt-get install libgomp1
30. Install Eigen
	sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
31. Install the Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit
	https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html#gs.j1gaw2
32. nop 
33. Add the proper oneAPI libraries to link. diffkt uses version 2.1.0, which is different from the Base Toolkit.
    cd <your git projects>diffkt/cpp/ops
    wget $(fwdproxy-config wget) https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN/releases/download/v2.1/dnnl_lnx_2.1.0_cpu_gomp.tgz
    tar -zxvf dnnl_lnx_2.1.0_cpu_gomp.tgz
    mv dnnl_lnx_2.1.0_cpu_gomp dnnl
34. If you are having build or link problems, try setting environmental variables to use Intel libraries
	source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
	Note: You may have link issues with the Intel libraries. For a quick work around, create a 
	symbolic link in /usr/lib to the library that is not linking.
35. In the file <your projects>/diffkt/cpp/ops/test/CMakeLists.txt, edit the following lines:

	old: target_link_libraries(SparseArithmeticTest PUBLIC SparseTestUtils)
	new: target_link_libraries(SparseArithmeticTest PUBLIC SparseTestUtils -liomp5)
	
	and
	
	old: target_link_libraries(SparseArithmeticPerfTest PUBLIC SparseTestUtils)
	new: target_link_libraries(SparseArithmeticPerfTest PUBLIC SparseTestUtils -liomp5)
	
35. mkdir build
36. cd build
37. cmake ..
39. make VERBOSE=1
40. If make completed without error, then the ops directory should be built and installed as the following:
    
	<your projects>/diffkt/kotlin/api/src/main/resources/libdnnlops_jni.so
	<your projects>/diffkt/kotlin/api/src/main/resources/libops_jni.so
	<your projects>/diffkt/kotlin/api/src/main/resources/libsparseops_jni.so

41. cd <your projects>/diffkt/cpp/gpuops
42. read README.md
43. Install libtorch in the gpuops directory. .gitignore is set to ignore the directory
	
	wget $(fwdproxy-config wget) https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cu92/libtorch-shared-with-deps-1.5.0%2Bcu92.zip
	unzip libtorch-shared-with-deps-1.5.0+cu92.zip
	rm libtorch-shared-with-deps-1.5.0+cu92.zip
44. This is an old verion of libtorch. A cmake file needs to be edited to use more cuurent versions of CUDA.
    Edit <your projects>/diffkt/cpp/gpuops/libtorch/share/cmake/Caffe2/public/cuda.cmake
    	find string "cudnn.h" and replace with "cudnn_version.h"
    	
45. mkdir build
46. cd build
47. cmake ..
48. make VERBOSE=1 -j
49. If make completed without error, then the ops directory should be built and installed as the following:

	<your projects>/diffkt/kotlin/api/src/main/resources/libgnuops_jni.so

50. The first line in diffkt/kotlin/gradlew has to be changed to 
	##!/usr/bin/env bash
	
	also you might change /bin/sh to a symbolic link to /bin/bash
	
	On Ubuntu /bin/sh is linked to /bin/dash. dash does not support the source command.
	Because of this diffkt/kotlin/scripts/set_env_vars.sh will not be called and 
	enviromental variables you need for gradle and for jni will not be set.
	
51. Intellij Idea does not use gradlew to do gradle builds.
    You need to source diffkt/kotlin/scripts/set_env_vars.sh in the shell that you use to startup Intellij Idea.
    
    I created a wrapper bash script that sourced the file and then called Intellij Idea. I then changed my <idea>.desktop file to point to the wrapper script
    
    	#/bin/bash
	source "<your projects directory>/diffkt/kotlin/scripts/set_env_vars.sh"
	"<your installation of Intellij>/bin/idea.sh"
    
    
52. Anytime you want to use the api.jar, you have to source diffkt/kotlin/scripts/setenv_vars.sh in the shell you are going to run the jvm

53. Anytine you want to run a kotlin jupyter notebook using api.jar, you have to source diffkt/kotlin/scripts/setenv_vars.sh in the shell you are going to run the notebook
		
54. cd <your projects>/diffkt/kotlin
55. read README.md
56. At GitHub make sure you token has "read:packages" scope.
57. Create the file github.env with the following in it:
	GITHUB_ACTOR=<your username>
	GITHUB_TOKEN=<your access token with the read:packages permission>
58. Start intellij
59. Open <you projects>/diffkt/kotlin
60. Build project
