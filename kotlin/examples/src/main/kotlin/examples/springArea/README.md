Spring Area is an example of automatic differentiation applied to three coupled springs.
The springs are pulled apart until they reach a desired area for the triangle formed by the three coupled 
springs. Spring Area shows how to use the gradient descent algorithm with using automatic differentiation 
on a loss functions, while also solving an ordinary differential equation, where automatic differentiation 
is applied to the energy function of the springs to produce the acceleration in the 
ordinary differential equation of the coupled springs.
