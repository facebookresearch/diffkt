Linear Regression is an example of linear regression with a stochastic descent algorithm. Linear Regression uses
part of the neural network package available in **DiffKt**. The Linear
Regression example is a one layer neural network with a L2 loss function.

The neural network package in **DiffKt** is in
diffkt/kotlin/api/src/main/kotlin/org/diffkt/model. Helper classes for examples working with the neural 
network models are in diffkt/examples/src/main/kotlin/examples/api.
