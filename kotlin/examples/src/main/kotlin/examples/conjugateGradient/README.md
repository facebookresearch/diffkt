Conjugate Gradient has two examples using the Newton Conjugate Gradient Optimizer. One example is a minimization 
problem and the other is for solving a linear system. The code for the optimizer is actually in 
diffkt/examples/src/main/kotlin/examples/utils/conjugateGradient. The Newton Conjugate Gradient
Optimizer demonstrates the use of the Jacobian - vector API for automatic differentiation.
