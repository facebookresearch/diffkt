If you encounter any issues, feel free to report it using GitHub issues. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

## Pull Requests

TODO: Decide on PR best practices. 

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

## Deployment

To deploy DiffKt to the Central Repository: 

1. Create a Sontatype JIRA account at `issues.sontatype.org` 
2. File an issue to get rights to push to `com.facebook`
3. Install [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org) and generate GPG keys 

     1. On MacOS it is recommended to use Homebrew: `brew install gnupg` 
     2. Generate a key pair, provide a passphrase when prompted: `gpg --gen-key` 
     3. List the key pairs and note the last 8 characters of the 40-character key ID string: `gpg --list-keys`
     4. Move into the  _.gnugpg_ directory: `cd ./.gnugpg`
     5. Export the secret key: `gpg --keyring secring.gpg --export-secret-keys > ~/.gnupg/`
     6. Send the public key to the Ubuntu server, replace the `XXXXXXXXX` placeholder with the key ID or last 8 characters of the key ID: `gpg --send-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com XXXXXXXXX`     

4. In your personal _.gradle_ directory outside the project (often in directory like _/Users/thomasnield/.gradle/_) create a _gradle.properties_ file and add the following contents to it. Be sure to provide the following information and change the _signing.secretKeyRingFile_ file to your _securing.gpg_ file path. 

```
repositoryUsername=[your Sonatype JIRA username]
repositoryPassword=[your Sonatype JIRA password]
signing.keyId=[last 8 characters of the key ID]
signing.password=[your passphrase for the key]
signing.secretKeyRingFile=/Users/thomasnield/.gnupg/secring.gpg
```

5. In the _diffkt/kotlin/api/build.gradle.kts_ script, change the release version. 

```
pom { 
...
                version = "X.X.X"
...
}
```

6. In the _diffkt/kotlin/api_ directory run the publish command: ` ./gradlew clean publish`
7. Upon success, log into [Staged Repositories](https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories) with your Sonatype JIRA account, select the artifact you just uploaded, close it, wait a few minutes for it to process, refresh, and then click "Release."
8. Within an hour the artifact release should be visible in [the repository](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/facebook/diffkt/).
